    You need to confirm who you are before you can check your State Pension.

    To do this, you can create either a Government Gateway user ID or a GOV.UK Verify identity account.

    ## Government Gateway

    You'll need:

    - your National Insurance number or UK address
    - a recent payslip or P60 or a valid UK passport
    
    You can use your user ID for things like your personal or business tax account, Self Assessment, Corporation Tax, PAYE for employers and VAT.

    ## GOV.UK Verify

    GOV.UK Verify works best if you're over 20 years old. You'll need:

    - a UK address
    - a mobile phone
    - at least one valid photo ID from any country
    
    You can use your identity account for things like Universal Credit, requesting a basic DBS check and Self Assessment.
