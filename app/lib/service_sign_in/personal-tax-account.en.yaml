    ## Government Gateway

    You'll need:

    - your National Insurance number or UK address
    - a recent payslip or P60 or a valid UK passport
    
    You can use your user ID for things like your personal or business tax account, Self Assessment, Corporation Tax, PAYE for employers and VAT.

    - a UK address
